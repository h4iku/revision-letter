#+TITLE: Journal Revision Letter

This repository contains a simple LaTeX template,
=review-response.tex=, for a journal revision cover letter. The
template contains two environments, called =revcom= and =response=,
that are used to explain how the reviewers' (most substantial)
comments have been addressed. Both of these environments are contained
in =include/defs.tex=. In addition to the LaTeX template, which
demonstrates simple usage of these environments, the repository also
contains a generated sample PDF file, =review-response.pdf=.
